const storyContent = 'Off the coasts of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and \
Florida, our enslaved ancestors formed an entirely unique culture that was a mix of West\
and Central African, as well as Native American. Using the ingredients that were available\
in Lowcountry, such as crabs, rice, okra, grits, and others, they created what has become the \
roots of most Southern dishes like Fried Chicken and Shrimp and Grits. We hope that  through \
our sharing of these dishes, you\'ll come to further appreciate and understand Gullah Geechee \
history and culture.';
